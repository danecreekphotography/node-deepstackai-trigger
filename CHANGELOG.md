# Change Log

## Version 1.3.0

- The default mount point for the image folder in the sample configuration now points
  to /aiinput. This better aligns with future documentation and will simplify configuration
  for first time users following the step by step guide. Existing `docker-compose.yml` and
  `trigger.conf` files aren't impacted as they won't be copying the new sample files locally.
  Developers working on the project using _Remote - Containers_ will need to rebuild their
  containers to pick up the new mount point. VSCode should automatically prompt for this.

## Version 1.2.1

- Changes try/catch to .catch() for issue [#68](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/68)

## Version 1.1.5

- Add a cooldownTime option to the Telegram handler. This makes it easier
  to have a trigger that fires frequently without spamming Telegram chats with
  pictures.

## Version 1.1.4

- Fixed a bug where MQTT log messages contained "Trigger" as the message tag.

## Version 1.1.3

- Resolve an issue where disabling Telegram prevented startup

## Version 1.1.2

- Add timestamp to log messages

## Version 1.1.1

- Added two optional dependencies to resolve build warnings

## Version 1.1.0

- Added support for Telegram bots

## Version 1.0.4

- Updated the README.md sample with the new MQTT message format
  from v1.0.1.

## Version 1.0.3

- There was no version 1.0.3. Tag issues with git.

## Version 1.0.2

- Minor file code structure cleanup

## Version 1.0.1

- MQTT messages now inclue a fileName and baseFileName property.
  Technically this is a breaking change since it moves the predictions
  to a predictions property too.

## Version 1.0.0

- Released 2020-05-25
- Initial release
