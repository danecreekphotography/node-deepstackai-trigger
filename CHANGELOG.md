# Change Log

## Version 1.7.0

- Add a `state` property to the MQTT messages sent on motion detection. This
  makes it easier to build binary motion sensors based on the MQTT messages in Home Assistant
  by using `value_template: 'value_json.state'`. The delay before sending an `off` state is
  configurable with the new `offDelay` setting on `mqtt` triggers. Resolves [issue 139](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/139) and [issue 141](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/141).

- Add a `"state": "on"` property to the MQTT messages sent on motion detection. This
  makes it easier to build binary motion sensors based on the MQTT messages in Home Assistant
  by using `value_template: 'value_json.state'` and `off_delay`. Resolves [issue 139](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/139).

## Version 1.6.0

- watchObjects is now case insensitive when comparing against the matched objects ([issue 134](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/134))
- Address a warning during config file validation ([issue 123](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/123)).
- Document the available Docker image tags ([issue 128](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/128)).
- Addresses code cleanup [issue 136](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/136).

## Version 1.5.0

- Configuration files can now be mounted using Docker volumes instead of secrets. While less
  secure for MQTT configuration it does enable this image to load on systems that don't support
  setting Docker secrets, such as a Synology. Addresses [issue 122](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/122).
- Address [issue 116](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/116).
- Address [issue 130](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/130).

## Version 1.4.0

- Add support for mask regions to triggers. See the [defining triggers](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/wiki/Defining-triggers#defining-masks)
  documentation for information on how to set this up.
- README.md updated to provide simplified instructions and links to
  the project wiki for additional details

## Version 1.3.0

- The default mount point for the image folder in the sample configuration now points
  to /aiinput. This better aligns with future documentation and will simplify configuration
  for first time users following the step by step guide. Existing `docker-compose.yml` and
  `trigger.conf` files aren't impacted as they won't be copying the new sample files locally.
  Developers working on the project using _Remote - Containers_ will need to rebuild their
  containers to pick up the new mount point. VSCode should automatically prompt for this.

## Version 1.2.1

- Changes try/catch to .catch() for issue [#68](https://github.com/danecreekphotography/node-deepstackai-trigger/issues/68)

## Version 1.1.5

- Add a cooldownTime option to the Telegram handler. This makes it easier
  to have a trigger that fires frequently without spamming Telegram chats with
  pictures.

## Version 1.1.4

- Fixed a bug where MQTT log messages contained "Trigger" as the message tag.

## Version 1.1.3

- Resolve an issue where disabling Telegram prevented startup

## Version 1.1.2

- Add timestamp to log messages

## Version 1.1.1

- Added two optional dependencies to resolve build warnings

## Version 1.1.0

- Added support for Telegram bots

## Version 1.0.4

- Updated the README.md sample with the new MQTT message format
  from v1.0.1.

## Version 1.0.3

- There was no version 1.0.3. Tag issues with git.

## Version 1.0.2

- Minor file code structure cleanup

## Version 1.0.1

- MQTT messages now inclue a fileName and baseFileName property.
  Technically this is a breaking change since it moves the predictions
  to a predictions property too.

## Version 1.0.0

- Released 2020-05-25
- Initial release
