# DeepStack AI Triggers

A Docker container that runs [DeepStack AI](https://deepstack.cc/) to process images from a watch
folder and then fire web request calls, MQTT events, and Telegram messages if the image matches a
defined list of triggers.

This project was heavily inspired by GentlePumpkin's post on [ipcamtalk.com](https://ipcamtalk.com/threads/tool-tutorial-free-ai-person-detection-for-blue-iris.37330/)
that triggers BlueIris video survelliance using DeepStack as the motion sensing system.
While the C# application is nifty it was difficult to install as a service and only ran on Windows.
This project is an attempt to take the idea behind the C# app, make it a bit more general purpose,
and provide quick deployment via Docker.

## General installation guidelines

- Copy the `docker-compose.yml`, `mqtt.json` and `triggers.json` files from the
  `sampleConfiguration` directory locally.
- Edit the `docker-compose.yml` file to modify the mount point for source images, set the timezone
  and optionally enable [MQTT](#configuring-mqtt) and [telegram](#configuring-telegram).
- Edit `triggers.json` to [define the triggers](#defining-triggers) you want to use.
- Edit `mqtt.json` to [specify the connection information](#configuring-mqtt) for your MQTT server (if using MQTT).
- Edit `telegram.json` to [specify the connection information](#configuring-telegram) for your Telegram bot
  server (if using Telegram).

Setting the timezone via the `TZ` environment variable in `docker-compose.yml` is important for
every thing to work smoothly. By default Docker containers are in UTC and that messes up
logic to skip existing images on restart. A list of valid timezones is available on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones). Use any value
from the `TZ database name` column.

Editing the .json files in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or some other editor
that understands JSON Schemas is recommended: you'll get full auto-complete and documentation as
you type.

After modifying the configuration files run `docker-compose up -d` and everything should
spin up and work. Use your Docker client to review log messages from the `trigger`
container: there's ample logging to help track down any configuration errors that
may exist.

## Defining triggers

The _trigger.conf_ file defines a list of triggers that fire when certain AI detection
parameters are met. Triggers can call a web request url, send an MQTT event, and
send an Telegram message when activated.

In the case of using this to make BlueIris start recording the web request URL is the way to go.
MQTT is useful if you want to do fancier automation based on the detected objects. Telegram
is nice if you want a quick photo notification of the event.

A sample file to start from is included in the _sampleConfiguration/triggers.json_ folder. As mentioned
above you'll have a happier time editing the trigger configuration if you use a text editor that supports
real-time schema validation (such as Visual Studio Code).

| Property     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Example                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| name         | Required. A name for the trigger. This is shown in the logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | `"Front door"`                 |
| watchPattern | Required. A wildcard pattern that determins which images are processed by this trigger. For Blue Iris use this will be something like "/aiinput/FrontDoorSD\*.jpg". By default the image folder is mounted to _/aiinput_ so unless you mounted the image folder elsewhere all watchPatterns should start with _/aiinput_. | `"/aiinput/FrontDoorSD\*.jpg"` |
| watchObjects | Required. An array of object types that the trigger watches for. The list of supported objects is available in the [DeepStack AI documentation](https://nodejs.deepstack.cc/object-detection) however the most useful are: "person", "car", "truck", "dog", "bear"                                                        | `["car", "truck", "person"]`   |
| handlers     | Required. A list of handlers that get called when the trigger fires. Currently [webRequest](#defining-webrequest-handlers), [mqtt](#defining-mqtt-handlers), and [Telegram](#defining-telegram-handlers) handlers are supported.                                                                                          |
| enabled      | Optional. Default `true`. When set to `false` the trigger will be ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | `false`                        |
| threshold    | Optional. A minimum and maximum threshold that must be satisifed for the trigger to fire. See [defining trigger thresholds](#defining-trigger-thresholds) for more information.                                                                                                                                           |                                |
| cooldownTime | Optional. Default 0. Specifies the length of time in seconds that have to pass between detected images for the trigger to fire again.                                                                                                                                                                                     | `60`                           |

### Defining trigger thresholds

The trigger threshold can help fine tune how sensitive the trigger is to detected objects. It is
optional and suggested to omit until you've looked at some of the output logs to see which
triggers need adjusting.

| Property | Description                                                                                                                               | Example |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| minimum  | Optional. Default `0`. A value between `0` and `100` that determines the minimum label confidence level required to activate the trigger. | `50`    |
| maximum  | Optional. Default `100`. A value between `0` and `100` that determines the maximum confidence level allowed to activate the trigger.      | `90`    |

### Defining webRequest handlers

A webRequest handler calls a web URI any time the trigger is fired. In the BlueIris use case this is how to define the URI that tells Blue Iris to start recording the HD camera. Note that you will
likely have to specify the host as an IP address rather than as a hostname if you want to
use a host on your internal network.

| Property    | Description                                                | Example                                                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| triggerUris | Required. An array of URIs to call when the trigger fires. | `"http://192.168.1.100:81/admin?trigger&camera=FrontDoorHD&user=username&pw=password"` |

### Defining mqtt handlers

An mqtt handler sends an MQTT event any time the trigger is fired. The event includes an array of all the predictions
that matched the trigger configuration, making it easy to do advanced automation based on the specific detected objects.

| Property | Description                                          | Example                        |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| topic    | Required. The topics to post when the trigger fires. | `"aimotion/trigger/FrontDoor"` |

Here is an example of the data sent in the message:

```javascript
{
  "fileName":"/aiinput/Dog_20200523-075000.jpg",
  "basename":"Dog_20200523-075000.jpg",
  "predictions":[
    {"confidence":0.9681682,
    "label":"dog",
    "y_min":31,
    "x_min":125,
    "y_max":784,
    "x_max":1209}
  ]
}
```

### Defining Telegram handlers

A Telegram handler sends message with the photo that triggered the event. See [Configuring Telegram](#configuring-telegram)
below for details on how to obtain chatIds.

| Property     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Example            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| chatIds      | Required. An array of chatIds to message when the trigger fires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | `[123123, 227352]` |
| cooldownTime | Optional. Default 0. Specifies the length of time in seconds that have to pass between detected images for the chat messages to get sent again. This is independent from the cooldownTime specified for the overall trigger, and allows the trigger to fire more often overall than the Telegram messages. | `60`               |

## Configuring MQTT

MQTT is enabled by uncommenting the `- mqtt` line in the `docker-compose.yml` file. See the comment above
the line in the file to be sure the right line is changed.

MQTT is configured using the _mqtt.conf_ file. The following properties are supported:

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               | Example                       |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| uri                | Required. The address of the MQTT server.                                                                                                                                                                 | `"mqtt://192.168.1.100:1883"` |
| username           | Optional. The username to log into the server with.                                                                                                                                                       | `"mqttuser"`                  |
| password           | Optional. The password to log into the server with.                                                                                                                                                       | `"mqttpass"`                  |
| rejectUnauthorized | Optional. Default true. Controls whether connections to mqtts:// servers should allow self-signed certificates. Set to false if your MQTT certificates are self-signed and are getting connection errors. | `false`                       |

The only authentication method currently supported is basic.

## Configuring Telegram

Telegram is enabled by uncommenting the `- telegram` line in the `docker-compose.yml` file. See the comment above
the line in the file to be sure the right line is changed.

Telegram is configured using the _telegram.conf_ file. The following properties are supported:

| Property | Description                                           | Example                                 |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| botToken | Required. The bot token for your Telegram bot server. | `"123987123:adfk2893r7akdskanfsdalskf"` |

Obtaining the `botToken` and `chatIds` for the trigger configuration is not hard but does take a few
steps. Here's what you need to do:

1. Contact `BotFather` on Telegram
2. Send the `/newbot` command. Follow the instructions and you'll get back a token that looks something like
   the one in the example above.
3. Connect to the bot in your Telegram personal account and send it a message
4. Go to `https://api.telegram.org/bot123987123:adfk2893r7akdskanfsdalskf/getUpdates`, after replacing
   the token in the URL with the one you obtained in step 2.
5. In the response look for the `id` field to obtain the chatId. In the below sample response the chatId is `12345`.

```javascript
{"ok":true,"result":[{"update_id":297596982,
"message":{"message_id":2,"from":{"id":12345,"is_bot":false,"first_name":"Neil","last_name":"Enns","language_code":"en"},"chat":{"id":12345,"first_name":"Neil","last_name":"Enns","type":"private"},"date":1590551469,"text":"hi"}}]}
```
